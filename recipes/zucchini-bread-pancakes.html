    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These zucchini bread pancakes are a delicious nod to zucchini bread, rich and fluffy with warm spices and speckled with zucchini throughout. The best part is that you can have the satisfaction of zucchini bread without heating up the oven.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>3/4 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter, plus more for the pan</li>
        <li>1 cup loosely packed shredded zucchini</li>
        <li>1/3 cup chopped walnuts (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Combine buttermilk, sugar, egg, and butter in a measuring cup; whisk well. Stir in shredded zucchini, and walnuts, then add to the dry ingredients. Fold together just until no dry spots remain.</li>
        <li>Heat a large nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat; grease with butter.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, scoop 1/4 cup batter per pancake into the skillet. Cook until bubbles begin to form on surface of pancakes and edges start to look dry, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip, and cook until fluffy and slightly firm, about 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter, adding butter and adjusting heat as needed.</li>
    </ol>
